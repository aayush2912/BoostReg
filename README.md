# BoostReg

This study explores the utilization of stability selection alongside L2 regularization and bootstrapping for feature selection within machine learning applications. Through comprehensive experimentation, the efficacy of stability selection in enhancing model stability and generalization across diverse classification tasks is assessed. The investigation primarily focuses on evaluating the influence of stability selection on key model performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results indicate that the integration of stability selection with L2 regularization and bootstrapping facilitates the identification of durable features across varied data subsets, ultimately enhancing model interpretability and mitigating overfitting risks. 

Key Responsibilities:
1. Implemented Stability Selection techniques to enhance model stability and generalization across various classification tasks.
2. Performed dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to manage high-dimensional data and improve computational efficiency.
3. Analyzed the dataset comprising various financial indicators (e.g., ROA, liquidity ratios, debt ratios) to assess company financial stability.
4. Applied techniques like SMOTE and undersampling to address class imbalance in the dataset.
5. Developed and tested multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machines.
6. Utilized Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV) for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Results:
1. Demonstrated that integrating stability selection with L2 regularization and bootstrapping significantly enhances model interpretability and reduces overfitting.
2. Achieved notable performance improvements, with Gradient Boosting Machines reaching an accuracy of 87.5% and an AUC-PR of 0.92.
3. Identified robust and predictive features, contributing to more effective and resilient financial data analysis models.
